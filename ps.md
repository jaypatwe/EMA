Ema APM Take-Home Project
Ema is growing fast. We believe the next generation of enterprise software will be powered by autonomous, agentic AI.
That's where you come in. This project is your chance to tackle a real problem enterprises are facing today.
The Problem: Rethinking Vehicle Insurance Claims Processing
Your job is to design a next-generation Claims Processing product for vehicle insurance companies that leverages agentic AI benefits.
Background: The Current State of Claims Processing
Today's claims management systems are complex systems of record designed to manage the end-to-end lifecycle of a claim, from the initial report to the final payment. They are often legacy systems, heavily customized, and require significant manual intervention from claims handlers.
Here's a brief overview of this problem space:
Key Stakeholders:
Claimant / Policyholder: The customer reporting the accident.
Claims Intake Specialist: The call center or web agent who receives the initial report (FNOL).
Claims Adjuster: The primary user who investigates the claim, assesses damage, determines liability, and authorizes a settlement.
Appraiser / Estimator: (Internal or 3rd party) Assesses the vehicle damage and estimates repair costs.
SIU (Special Investigations Unit): The internal team that investigates potential fraud.
Claims Manager: Oversees adjuster workloads, KPIs, and customer satisfaction.
High-Level Processes:
First Notice of Loss (FNOL)
Triage & Assignment 
Investigation & Adjudication
Settlement & Payout
What You'll Do
Identify Agentic Opportunities: Analyze the end-to-end claims workflow (e.g., FNOL, investigation, settlement) and identify specific areas that can be optimized and transformed using AI agents.
Define and Prioritize Your MVP: From your list of opportunities, prioritize and define a clear scope for an MVP of a B2B product (from the insurance company’s perspective). Justify why your chosen features are the most important to be part of the MVP.
Build Your Prototype: Create a working, interactive prototype for the MVP you defined. Use "vibe coding" to bring the core user journey of your agentic solution to life.
A Quick Guide to "Vibe Coding"
We want to see an interactive prototype. The goal is to get the "vibe" right to communicate your idea clearly. The tool you use doesn't matter as much as the final result and the thinking behind it.
Here are a few modern tools you could use to build quickly:
For AI-Powered Design: Check out tools like Lovable or Windsurf. They can help you generate user flows and wireframes directly from research insights.
For AI-Assisted Coding: If you're comfortable writing code, Cursor is an AI-native editor that speeds things up. Or use Replit to spin up a web app in your browser, no setup required.
What to Submit
You are expected to submit the following assets:
A Presentation (approx. 5 slides) that covers:
Your analysis of which insurance claims use cases should be "agentified."
Your MVP definition, prioritization, and the reasoning behind your choices.
A public link to your working MVP prototype.
Two additional slides in your presentation that speak to "A time when you demonstrated resilience. (This could be a personal or work-related experience.)"
