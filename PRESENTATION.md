# Presentation Draft: Ema Claims OS

## Slide 1: The Problem & Opportunity
*   **Current State**: Claims processing is slow, opaque, and administrative-heavy. Adjusters spend 70% of time on data entry, not adjudication.
*   **The Opportunity**: Move from "Process Automation" to **"Agentic Autonomy"**.
*   **Vision**: A **Hybrid Intelligence Claims OS** where AI agents handle high-volume simple claims autonomously, and act as "Super-Paralegals" for complex cases, preparing everything for a human decision.

## Slide 2: The Solution - Agentic Workflow
*   **Intake Agent**: Empathetic, conversational FNOL that adapts questions based on context (e.g., asking for injury details if impact is severe).
*   **Vision Agent**: Instant computer vision analysis of damage severity and repair cost estimation.
*   **SIU (Fraud) Agent**: Real-time cross-referencing of GPS, weather, and claim history to flag anomalies.
*   **Settlement Agent**: Auto-calculates payout based on policy limits and deductibles.

## Slide 3: MVP Definition & Scenarios
We prioritized a **"Hybrid Interface"** that serves both the AI's autonomous processing and the Adjuster's need for control.
*   **Scenario A: "Happy Path" (Auto-Approve)**
    *   *Input*: Minor bumper scratch, verified location.
    *   *Outcome*: **Instant Payout**. No human intervention.
*   **Scenario B: "Fraud Risk" (Stop & Flag)**
    *   *Input*: Mismatched GPS/Weather data.
    *   *Outcome*: **Review Required**. Claim flagged for SIU investigation.
*   **Scenario C: "High Severity" (Human-in-the-Loop)**
    *   *Input*: Major collision, potential injury.
    *   *Outcome*: **Escalation**. Agent prepares liability assessment but waits for Human Adjuster to finalize settlement.

## Slide 4: The Prototype - Key Features
*   **Interactive Demo**: [Insert Link]
*   **Split-Screen Architecture**: Left panel for "Case File" (Fact/Evidence), Right panel for "AI Reasoning" (Chain of Thought).
*   **Trust & Explainability**: Confidence scores and "Agent Reasoning" blocks explain *why* a decision was recommended.
*   **Seamless Handoff**: "Adjuster Override" controls allow humans to edit Liability/Settlement values when the AI is unsure.

## Slide 5: Resilience & Future Roadmap
*   **Resilience**: Built with a fault-tolerant agent architecture. If the "Vision Agent" fails, the workflow degrades gracefully to manual photo review rather than crashing.
*   **Roadmap**:
    1.  **Multi-Party**: Handling claims involving other insurers.
    2.  **Voice**: Processing intake via phone calls.
    3.  **Integration**: Writing final decisions back to core Policy Admin Systems.
